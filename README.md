# MadelinesHouse
Open development for Madeline's House in Farmville VA

Hello guys, if you are trying to set up a local dev invironment here is a list of what you will need.
  Virtual Box
  MySQL Workbench or another DBM 
  Vagrant, Scotchbox is the vagrant box we will be using. 
  Sublime Text helps more than you know. 
  The rest of the stuff is included in the repo. 
Hit me up for any questions, but mostly we should be working on the WP backend.
